In this project, I developed a prediction model for **OilyGiant**, an oil extraction company, aimed at identifying the most profitable locations for new wells. The model leverages **Machine Learning** algorithms to analyze historical data, geological factors, and market trends to predict the optimal sites for oil extraction, ensuring maximum return on investment (ROI).

### Key Steps in the Model:

1. **Data Collection**: We gathered data on previous oil well locations, production rates, geological features, and market conditions.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed the data, addressing missing values, outliers, and normalization for accurate model performance.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Identified and created new features such as geological risk factors, proximity to infrastructure, and market price volatility.
4. **Modeling**: Applied machine learning models such as **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** to predict well profitability, factoring in both extraction potential and associated risks.
5. **Risk-Benefit Analysis**: Integrated a risk-benefit framework to evaluate potential profits in relation to environmental, regulatory, and operational risks, helping the company make data-driven, sustainable decisions.

### Results:

- **Profitability Forecast**: Successfully predicted high-return areas with an accuracy of %, leading to more targeted exploration efforts.
- **Risk Assessment**: The model included a comprehensive risk-benefit analysis, enabling the company to make informed decisions about potential investment areas while minimizing environmental and operational risks.
